# dRunner

dRunner is a script and a set of conventions to make it easy to install, 
configure and use Docker containers on a Debian host via the command line interface.

dRunner eliminates the need to separately store and manage scripts to use the Docker container, 
or deal with long docker run commands.

Features:
* dRunner compatible Docker Images are self contained - everything dRunner needs is inside
* Simple discoverable commands for using compatible services (no manual needed)
* Flexible configuration for each service, stored in Docker Volume containers that are managed for you
* Services can consist of any number of containers
* Backup an entire service to a single file, trivially restore on another machine
* Destroying a service leaves the machine in a clean state, no cruft left
* Everything in containers is run as a non-root user
* Trivial to install a service multiple times with different configurations (e.g. mulitple minecraft servers)
* Ansible friendly for automation (see [Exit Codes](https://github.com/j842/dr#exit-codes) below).
* Small footprint: /opt/drunner, /etc/drunner and one symbolic link per service in /usr/local/bin

# Usage

## Example

### First time installation

#### Dependencies

dRunner needs docker. You can install it with:
```
   wget -nv -O /tmp/install_docker.sh https://goo.gl/2cxobx ; bash /tmp/install_docker.sh
```
#### Installing Docker Runner

Install dRunner on the host by downloading the install script:
```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drunner/install/master/drunner-install
    bash drunner-install
```
Now you're ready to try things.

### Running some containers

#### Helloworld

Install and try the [helloworld](https://github.com/j842/docker-dr-helloworld) example:
```
    drunner install drunner/helloworld
    helloworld run
```
helloworld is now in your path, you can run it directly, e.g. with no arguments
to see the help.

Back up helloworld to an encrypted archive (including all settings and local data), 
then destroy it, leaving the machine clean:
```
   PASS=shh drunner backup helloworld hw.b
   drunner destroy helloworld
```
Restore the backup as hithere, and run it:
```   
   PASS=shh drrunner restore hw.b hi
   hi run
```

### Running some tests

dRunner can test containers for compatibility and functionality. Try it out with:
```
   drunner install drunner/dtest
   dtest test drunner/helloworld
```
### dRunner Images to play with

Other images to try:
* [minecraft](https://github.com/j842/drunner-minecraft) - really easy minecraft server.
* [simplesecrets](https://github.com/j842/drunner-simplesecrets) - store low security secrets in S3.
* [samba](https://github.com/drunner/samba) - run samba for development work.

(more coming soon!)

## General Use

Install a container (e.g. from DockerHub) that supports dr and call the service 'SERVICENAME'.
```
    drunner install IMAGENAME SERVICENAME
```

Manage that service:
```
    SERVICENAME COMMAND ARGS
```
The available COMMANDs depend on the service; they can be things like run and configure. You can get help on the service
which also lists the available COMMANDs with
```
    SERVICENAME
```

Other commands that work on all services:
```
drunner destroy SERVICENAME                    -- destroy service and ALL data! Leaves host in clean state.
drunner update SERVICENAME                     -- update service scripts from container (and docker pull)

PASS=? drunner backup SERVICENAME BACKUPFILE   -- backup container, configuration and local data.
PASS=? drunner restore BACKUPFILE SERVICENAME  -- restore container, configuration and local data.
```
   

# dRunner Compatibility

To see how to make a dRunner compatible docker image [read the documentation](https://github.com/j842/dRunner/blob/master/MAKECOMPATIBLE.md).

## Exit Codes

The convention for exit codes is:
* 0 for success,
* 1 for error and 
* 3 for no change 

This is to aid Ansible use.

## Security
See [Docker's Security Statement](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security) for information on security and docker.
There's a long way to go. For now, using sudo to run docker doesn't give you much over running as root - since with sudo you can
trivially map the host filesystem into a container and do whatever you want to it. Because of this, dRunner focuses
on security aspects that help, such as insisting containers are not run as root user. Avoid priveleged containers and
mapping the docker socket where possible and audit any scripts run on the host (dRunner makes this easy since they are all in one place).
